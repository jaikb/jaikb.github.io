<h2>About Me</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Hello! My name is Jai Bansal <em>(pronounced like the letter J)</em>.</p>

<h3>Why did I start this blog?</h3>

<p>At my first semester at Cal, every computer science major has to take this course called <a href="www.cs61a.org" title="CS61A">CS61A: Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</a>. For me it was one of the most interesting, fun, knowledgable, stressful, and difficult course I have ever taken in my educational career. During finals week I was searching the CS61A course website for advice on how to do well on the final when I stumbled across this blog by <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/about-me/" title="Joel Spolsky">Joel Spolsky</a> called <a href="www.joelonsoftware.com" title="Joel on Software">Joel on Software</a>. The article that Joel had written was about advice for computer science students. If you want to read the whole thing I’ve linked it <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2005/01/02/advice-for-computer-science-college-students/" title="Advice for Computer Science Students">here</a>, but in a nutshell, Spolsky makes seven key points that every computer science student should consider doing while getting their degree. The one that really hit home for me was his first point: <strong>Learn how to write before graduating</strong> Joel’s main argument was what 2separates most good programmers from the great programmers is that great programmers know how to communicate their ideas more effectively than good programmers. He encouraged people to write and write often because the more you write the easier it gets to write well etc. I can’t say much to how much this blog has helped me <strong>yet</strong>, but, nevertheless, here I am blogging!</p>

<h3>How often do you post?</h3>

<p>I don’t have any hard posting dates. I’d say around weekly, but I would not hold myself to that.</p>

<h3>What Do I write about?</h3>

<p>To be honest really anything. This blog isn’t really intended for anyone or anything. I mostly have started this as a hobby and to make myself a better writer and I don’t want it to become a burden. So anything I think I should share or want to write my thoughts about I will share and that’s what it is!</p>

<h3>Quick Facts</h3>
