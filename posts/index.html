<h1>Why Doing Less is Sometimes Doing More</h1>

<p>I was a straight A student back in high school and at least the stereotype for me was that taking as many AP Classes as possible and getting good grades in them meant that I was <strong>smart</strong>. For me doing more and doing well was something I took pride in. I came into my freshman year at Berkeley with the same mindset. I was at a school with some of the brightest kids in the country and I needed to somehow set myself apart from everyone. Many times I heard sayings like</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Take your first semester at Berkeley easy, it’s a big adjustment and a different rigor” - random Berkeley student</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would then proceed to look at all the averages of classes I was gonna take on <a href="www.berkeleytime.com" title="Berkeley Time">Berkeley Time</a> and scoff at people getting Bs or B+s in these classes <em>(especially in the CS classes)</em>. I’ve always been above average and what was to change in college. <em>Oh how wrong I was</em></p>

<p>The thing about a top university is they humble everyone real quick. No one is above the system <strong>especially at Berkeley</strong>. So I took a pretty heavy course load my first semester. The recommended course load for a freshman is around 14 units. <em>A unit</em> at Berkeley is defined as 3 hours of course work per week. For some people doing about 42 hours of work per week is pretty good, but for me? Nah. I wanted to do <strong>57</strong>. That’s right, I took 19 units my first semester of college. The classes included: </p>

<ul>
	<li>CS61A: Structure and Interpretations of Programs (B average)</li>
	<li>Math 54: Linear Algebra and Differential Equations (B average)</li>
	<li>Data 8: Foundations of Data Science (B+ average)</li>
	<li>History 7A: History of U.S. from Settlement to Civil War (B+ average)</li>
	<li>Introduction to Mathematical Thinking (Pass No Pass Class)</li>
</ul>

<p>I thought I could handle all this course load consisting of three technical classes and one class I need to take for a breath requirement through my College of Letters and Sciences. Keep in mind also, for me to declare my CS major, I have to get an average of a <strong>3.3 GPA</strong> <em>(B+ average)</em> over three CS classes at Berkeley and one of them is CS61A. </p>
