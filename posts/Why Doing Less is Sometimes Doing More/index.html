<h1>Why Doing Less is Sometimes Doing More</h1>

<p>I was a straight A student back in high school and at least the stereotype for me was that taking as many AP Classes as possible and getting good grades in them meant that I was <strong>smart</strong>. For me doing more and doing well was a sense of satisfaction. I came into my freshman year at Berkeley with the same mindset. I was at a school with some of the brightest kids in the country and I needed to somehow set myself apart from everyone. Many times I heard sayings like</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Take your first semester at Berkeley easy, it’s a big adjustment and a different rigor” - random Berkeley student</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would then proceed to look at all the averages of classes I was gonna take on <a href="www.berkeleytime.com" title="Berkeley Time">Berkeley Time</a> and scoff at people getting Bs or B+s in these classes. I’ve always been above average and what was to change in college. <em>Oh how wrong I was</em></p>
