<h1>Advice to Incoming Freshman in College</h1>

<p>I was a straight A student back in high school and at least the stereotype for me was that taking as many AP Classes as possible and getting good grades in them meant that I was <strong>smart</strong>. For me doing more and doing well was something I took pride in. I came into my freshman year at Berkeley with the same mindset. I was at a school with some of the brightest kids in the country and I needed to somehow set myself apart from everyone. Many times I heard sayings like</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Take your first semester at Berkeley easy, it’s a big adjustment and a different rigor” - random Berkeley student</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would then proceed to look at all the averages of classes I was gonna take on <a href="www.berkeleytime.com" title="Berkeley Time">Berkeley Time</a> and scoff at people getting Bs or B+s in these classes <em>(especially in the CS classes)</em>. I’ve always been above average and what was to change in college. <em>Oh how wrong I was</em></p>

<p>The thing about a top university is they humble everyone real quick. No one is above the system <strong>especially at Berkeley</strong>. So I took a pretty heavy course load my first semester. The recommended course load for a freshman is around 14 units. <em>A unit</em> at Berkeley is defined as 3 hours of course work per week. For some people doing about 42 hours of work per week is pretty good, but for me? Nah. I wanted to do <strong>57</strong>. That’s right, I took 19 units my first semester of college. The classes included: </p>

<ul>
	<li>CS61A: Structure and Interpretations of Programs (B average)</li>
	<li>Math 54: Linear Algebra and Differential Equations (B average)</li>
	<li>Data 8: Foundations of Data Science (B+ average)</li>
	<li>History 7A: History of U.S. from Settlement to Civil War (B+ average)</li>
	<li>Introduction to Mathematical Thinking (Pass No Pass Class)</li>
</ul>

<p>I thought I could handle all this course load consisting of three technical classes and one class I need to take for a breath requirement through my College of Letters and Sciences. Keep in mind also, for me to declare my CS major, I have to get an average of a <strong>3.3 GPA</strong> <em>(B+ average)</em> over three CS classes at Berkeley and one of them is CS61A. </p>

<p>Needless to say even though I put in some considerable amount of work towards all my classes <em>(finals week was almost the end of me)</em>, but I still ended up doing worse than I hoped to do coming into the semester. </p>

<p>I hope you take this story with a grain of salt and learn form my mistakes. So here are a few tips to survive college and life in general patented by me, a college student trying to figure it out. </p>

<h2>Create Priorities</h2>

<p>Life isn’t all about school. If you spend every waking moment going to class, then discussions, then lab, then office hours, then review session etc., you’re going to go insane. <em>Trust me I almost did.</em> Create a clear cut plan of what you want to get done in a week so that you can maintain a balance in your life. When college arrives, every student is the driver of their car called <strong>your time</strong> and we have to do everything to not swerve off the road into the deep end. Create clear cut priorities of this is the amount of classes I want to take per semester so that I can do my major in X amount of time. I want to work out this many times in a week, and spend this much time with friends. When I know how much time I want to dedicate to each important activity in my life I end up being a lot happier in the end.</p>

<h2>Plan the Work, Work the Plan</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>“If you want to get everything that you want done, create a plan and then execute it. Plan the work, then work the plan Jai.” - my Dad</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thanks Dad. I wish I had listened to you sooner. Once you have a set of priorities, you have to block out time each day of every week to spend that dedicated amount of time on that priority. Most of the time, when I don’t have a schedule of things to do, <strong>especially on the weekends</strong>, I just end up wasting time either on YouTube or Reddit or talking to friends or what not. Then Sunday night roles around and then <strong>BAM</strong>, all my priorities hit me like a truck. Take my advice, and avoid my suffering. I’m going to link <a href="http://www.jamesmaa.com/2012/12/02/james-maas-productivity-hacking-guide/" title="James Maa Productivity Guide">this article</a> by a former Berkeley CS alum who has his own blog <em>(and inspired me to start my own)</em>. The article is a productive hacking guide and it’s super useful if you’re new to effectively planning how you want your calendar to look and execute on them. Take a look and be sure to follow through on the advice James gives you. It’ll help you in the long run. </p>
